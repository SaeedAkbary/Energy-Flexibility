# Energy Flexibility
ðŸ”Œ Smart House Energy Flexibility Analysis
This project introduces a novel methodology for evaluating the energy flexibility of residential consumers under varying operational conditions, with a focus on smart homes. It proposes innovative flexibility indicators that quantify the potential of residential energy systems to support grid stability and economic efficiency.

Using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) framework, the model manages energy flows in a smart house, scheduling shiftable appliances and an Energy Storage System (ESS). By defining different consumption strategies, it explores the feasible region of Energy-Time Profiles (ETPs) and evaluates how various operational constraints impact flexibility.

Key features:

Formulation of smart house energy management as an MILP problem

Scheduling of flexible appliances and ESS

Generation and analysis of Energy-Time Profiles (ETPs)

Introduction of novel flexibility indicators

Sensitivity analysis of key parameters (including ESS specs)

The results demonstrate that the proposed indicators effectively capture and quantify the flexibility potential of smart houses, offering valuable insights for energy system planning and demand-side management.
